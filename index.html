   <h2>Causes of Climate Change</h2>

     	<ul>
<li>Human expansion of the “greenhouse effect”, the atmosphere traps heat radiating from earth toward space.</li>
<li>The earth works the same way as greenhouses do, the sunlight gets trapped inside of the glass container, this is how the greenhouse can keep plants warm even throughout the drastic climate changes.</li>
<li>The most common greenhouse gasses are: Water vapor, Carbon dioxide, Methane, Nitrous Oxide, and Chlorofluorocarbons.</li>
<li>Over these past centuries we have been burning fossil fuels, such as oil and coal. The burning of fossil fuels has increased the concentration of carbon dioxide.</li>
